# Periodic Table Project

## Overview

This project showcases the use of css to create highly responsive grid layouts to demostrate my frontend development skills. To achieve the intended layout, I had to use css grid, flexbox and the position property.
This project is not just about representing the chemical elements, but about effectively utilizing CSS to manage a complex layout, ensuring that it is adaptable and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating a semantic and accessible structure of the periodic table.

- **CSS3**: for creating the layout, css grid and flexbox was used to achieve the grid of boxes housing the each element's name.

- **JavaScript**: Although the primary focus is on CSS, JavaScript was used for enhancing interactivity to check box representing such that when you click on it plays an audio file; telling you the name of the element.

- **Responsive Design**: Techniques such as media queries and flexible grid layouts to ensure the table looks great on all screen sizes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Responsive Web Design**: Proficiency in building layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring accessibility and usability.

- **Attention to Detail**: Custom styling for each element, hover effects, and transitions, showcasing a focus on user experience and aesthetic design.
